Although Ritvo's study is not specifically a feminist text, she makes reference to language employed by
naturalists and animal breeders that sets both women and animals below human males in the natural
hierarchy.11 The use of sexual metaphor, which feminists believe had the effect of establishing a
male-dominated hierarchy, was also employed in the language of the scientific revolution. The taming of
nature was usually described in gendered terms that reflected the social order. Feminist scholars have
drawn attention to the sexual metaphors employed by Francis Bacon and other Enlightenment scientists.
Central to Bacon's scientific investigations was a natural world, frequently described as a woman, that
required taming, shaping, and subduing by the scientific mind: "I am come in very truth leading you to
nature with all her children to bind her to your service and make her your slave."12 Social ecologist
William Leiss agrees that Bacon's scientific project was centrally concerned with mastery over nature.
But while Leiss notes the sexually aggressive overtones in Bacon's language, he is less concerned with
the implications of Bacon's sexual metaphors than with a scientific tradition that has resulted in the
domination of certain men over other human beings. This system of domination has spread outward from
Europe to the rest of the world through the appropriation of nature's resources.13
